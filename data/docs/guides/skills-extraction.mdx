## Overview

The skills extraction system uses a combination of NLP techniques and AI models to accurately identify technical skills and expertise levels from text.

## Basic Usage

<CodeTabs
  tabs={{
    "Node.js": `const client = new SJMClient({ apiKey: 'your_api_key' });
const skills = await client.extractSkills("Looking for a React Native developer with TypeScript experience");`,
    "Python": `from sjm_client import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")
skills = client.extract_skills("Looking for a React Native developer with TypeScript experience")`,
    "REST": `curl -X POST https://api.sjm.dev/v1/skills/extract \\
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
-d '{
"text": "Looking for a React Native developer with TypeScript experience"
}'`
}}
/>

## Skill Verification

<CodeHighlight
  code={`const result = await client.verifySkill("reactjs");
console.log(result);
// Output:
{
  exists: true,
  similar_terms: ["React.js", "React Native"],
  type: "skill",
  matches: ["React.js"]
}`}
  language="javascript"
/>
